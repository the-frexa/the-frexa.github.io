I"<p>When learning to code for the first time, it can be overwhelming to see terms like <strong>functional</strong> or <strong>object-oriented</strong> be thrown around by more experienced programmers. In this series of articles, I wanted to give a brief overview of what these paradigms actually mean, and demonstrate some very small programs implementing some of these. These articles are not meant to be comprehensive in any fashion, although I do go over the most common paradigms and try to give you a sense of what they mean.</p>
